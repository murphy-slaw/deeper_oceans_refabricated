# Deeper Oceans: Refabricated

This is a continuation of [Deeper Oceans](https://modrinth.com/datapack/deeper-oceans) by Apollo, as a Fabric mod.

Just like the original version, this extends oceans to around 3x their normal depth. It also includes a mixin (originally from [Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tectonic)) that adjusts ocean monument generation to account for the lower sea floor.

## Incompatibilities
This mod conflicts with Tectonic. But everything in this mod is in Tectonic, so if you have Tectonic, you don't need this mod.

## Acknowledgements
None of this would be possible without the work of [Apollo](https://modrinth.com/user/Apollo) and their generosity in releasing the original Deeper Oceans and Tectonic code under the MIT license.
